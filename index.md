# About TORCHLITE

This page will describe in general what the TORCHLITE dashboard is and its purpose. 

## What does TORCHLITE mean?
TORCHLITE is an acronym that stands for Tools for Open Research and Computation with HathiTrust: Leveraging Intelligent Text Extraction. 

There are three important pieces of this project to note:
* the TORCHLITE visualization dashboard (shown in the image below, and the primary feature of this documentation)
* the Extracted Features (EF) dataset
* the EF API

The [TORCHLITE dashboard](https://torchlite.htrc.illinois.edu/dashboard) extends volume-level, page-level, and fine-grain access to our [Extracted Features (EF) dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/deriveddatasets), which contains metadata and statistical information extracted from the full-text data representing 17.5 million digitized volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library. As part of TORCHLITE, HTRC has developed a well-documented API and an interactive data visualization dashboard.

This documentation is basic user documentation for the [TORCHLITE dashboard](https://torchlite.htrc.illinois.edu/dashboard). For developer documentation related to extracted features and the visualization dashbaord, please visit our [github repository](https://github.com/htrc).
