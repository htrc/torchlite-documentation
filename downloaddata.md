# How to download extracted features data
This page will show you how to directly download the extracted features data for your workset. You might be interested in downloading the data to do your own analysis or create visualizations outside of the dashbardo. The extracted features data for a workset can be downloaded in the form of JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) files. JSON files are commonly used file format, particularly in web development and APIs. They are text files that store data in a structured, human-readable format using key-value pairs and arrays. 

You can download the full data for your workset which includes the metadata and feature data for every item in your workset. Alternatively you can download just the filtered data, and filtered metadata only which will restrict what you download to the items you haven't filtered out.
